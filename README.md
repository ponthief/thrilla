# WhiSPa Wallet — Bitcoin Silent Payments

WhiSPa is a self-custodial **Bitcoin** wallet built on **Silent Payments
([BIP-352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki))**.
It's a React Native (Android/iOS) app; a Vue web app lives in the same repo.

## What is it for?

Silent Payments let you publish **one reusable address** and receive to it as
many times as you like — **without reusing an address on-chain**. Each payment
the sender makes derives a fresh, unlinkable output, so your incoming payments
can't be tied together by a static address on the blockchain. You get the
convenience of a single "always-on" address with much better privacy than a
normal reused address, and without running an interactive server to hand out
fresh addresses.

- **Reusable, shareable address.** Publish your `sp1…` address (QR, link, or a
  memorable **BitMail** name like `you@whispawallet.com` via
  [BIP-353](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0353.mediawiki)).
- **Self-custodial.** Keys are derived **on-device** from a BIP-39 seed at the
  BIP-352 path (`m/352'`). Your **spend key never leaves the phone**. The scan
  key is only uploaded if you opt into **background scanning** — and it can
  *detect* payments but can never spend them.
- **Real Bitcoin, on-chain.** Your coins are ordinary UTXOs on the Bitcoin
  blockchain, spendable to Silent Payment, on-chain (`bc1…`), or BitMail
  recipients. The backend only stores *references* to your scanned UTXOs; the
  bitcoin itself always lives on-chain and is recoverable from your seed.
- **Coin control & privacy tools.** See, label, and **freeze** individual
  coins; dust from third parties is flagged so you can avoid it.
- **Notifications.** Get a push when a payment arrives (even with the app
  closed) via an opt-in background scanner — the amount is shown in-app, not to
  the push provider. Prefer to receive silently? Turn **Payment alerts** off in
  Settings → Notifications (per device).
- **Lock & duress.** Biometric or in-app PIN lock, plus an optional **duress
  PIN** that wipes this device's keys and signs out. Sending re-authenticates.

WhiSPa talks to a self-hosted **LNbits** instance running the **siLNt**
extension (the scanner/indexer backend). Builds are provided for **mainnet** and
**signet**.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Android SDK (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development on macOS)

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

**Start Metro bundler:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Run on Android (in another terminal):**
```bash
npm run android          # mainnet debug
npm run android:signet   # signet debug
```

**Run on iOS (macOS only):**
```bash
npm run ios
```

### Build a release APK

The app has `mainnet` and `signet` build flavors (each pulls its own `.env`):

```bash
npm run apk:mainnet   # → android/app/build/outputs/apk/mainnet/release/
npm run apk:signet    # → android/app/build/outputs/apk/signet/release/
```

**Signing:** release builds are signed with your own keystore when its
credentials are present as Gradle properties (kept **outside** the repo, in
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`).

> The `THRILLA_*` names below — and `THRILLA_DRY_RUN`, `THRILLA_GPG_KEY` and
> `THRILLA_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256` further down — are not leftover copy. They are
> the literal property and environment-variable names that `build.gradle` and
> the scripts read, they are what the GitHub Actions secrets are called, and
> they are in every contributor's `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`. Renaming them
> here without renaming them everywhere would document a setup that does not
> work. Same reason the app's id stays `com.thrilla_btc.thrilla`: Android
> treats a changed id as a different app, so installed users would stop
> receiving updates.

```properties
THRILLA_STORE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/thrilla-release.keystore
THRILLA_KEY_ALIAS=thrilla
THRILLA_STORE_PASSWORD=…
THRILLA_KEY_PASSWORD=…
```

Generate the keystore once with:
```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore thrilla-release.keystore \
        -alias thrilla -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
```
Without those properties, release builds fall back to the debug key (fine for
local testing, never for distribution). **Back up the keystore + passwords** —
losing them means you can't ship updates.

### Publish a verifiable release

The APKs are sideloaded from a website, so nothing about the transport proves
where a build came from. Two independent checks cover that, and a release
should ship both.

**1. The APK signing certificate.** Android already enforces this: an APK
signed by a different key cannot replace an installed WhiSPa, so every user
is protected whether or not they check anything. Publish the fingerprint so
they *can* check:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs whispa-mainnet.apk | grep -i 'SHA-256 digest'
```

**2. A GPG signature over the checksums.** This covers the download itself,
before it is ever installed. One signature over a `SHA256SUMS` file covers
every artifact — the layout Bitcoin Core and Tor use, so the steps are ones
people may already know.

CI builds and release-signs the APKs but cannot do this part: the GPG key is
deliberately not on the build machine, since a key CI can reach is a key
everyone with push access can reach. So one command finishes a release from
the machine that holds the key:

```bash
scripts/cut-release.sh v0.1.1              # fetch the CI builds, sign, publish
scripts/cut-release.sh v0.1.1 main.apk signet.apk   # or sign local builds
THRILLA_DRY_RUN=1 scripts/cut-release.sh v0.1.1     # stop before publishing
```

It refuses to publish APKs signed by two different keys, or by the debug key —
Gradle falls back to the debug keystore silently, and a debug-signed build
installs and runs, which is what makes it dangerous: nothing properly signed
can ever replace it. Set `THRILLA_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256` and it also refuses
anything not signed by the key you expect.

The assets get **stable names** — `whispa-mainnet.apk`, `whispa-signet.apk`,
`SHA256SUMS`, `SHA256SUMS.asc` — and the release is not a prerelease. That is
what lets the download page link to
`releases/latest/download/whispa-mainnet.apk` and never need editing: GitHub
resolves `latest` to the newest non-prerelease release, so the rolling `ci-*`
builds from Actions are skipped and only a signed release is ever offered to a
user.

`sign-release.sh` does the checksum-and-sign step alone, if you want it:

```bash
scripts/sign-release.sh path/to/*.apk      # → SHA256SUMS + SHA256SUMS.asc
THRILLA_GPG_KEY=<key-id> scripts/sign-release.sh    # pick a specific key
```

The script checksums the APKs, signs the sums, **verifies the signature it
just made** (a bad signature that ships reads to users as a compromised
build), and prints both fingerprints.

The current key is `F061 E3E9 56FC F57F 99D2  FE48 81DC EBD9 74E9 CABE`,
`WhiSPa Wallet <admin@whispawallet.com>`. First time only, or to start over:

```bash
gpg --quick-generate-key "WhiSPa Wallet <admin@whispawallet.com>" ed25519 sign 3y
gpg --armor --export <key-id> > whispa-signing-key.asc
```

**Changing the name on the key is not the same as replacing the key.** The uid
was swapped once already — added, made primary, old one revoked — and because
the fingerprint did not move, every release signed before that still verifies.
Rotating the key itself means a new fingerprint, re-signing every published
release, and every user having to learn the new one out of band, so it is
reserved for a key that is compromised or lost:

```bash
gpg --quick-add-uid         <key-id> "New Name <new@example.com>"
gpg --quick-set-primary-uid <key-id> "New Name <new@example.com>"
gpg --quick-revoke-uid      <key-id> "Old Name <old@example.com>"
gpg --armor --export        <key-id> > whispa-signing-key.asc
```

Revoking a uid hides it and marks it invalid; it does not delete it. The old
string stays in the key bytes, and anyone who imported the key earlier keeps
seeing the old name until they run `gpg --refresh-keys`. After any uid change,
`download.html` in the siLNt repo has to match what `gpg` now prints — both
the signing-key line and the sample output — or the verify page is teaching
people to accept a mismatch.

Then publish, per release:

- `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc` next to the APKs
- `whispa-signing-key.asc` on the site (once)
- the key fingerprint in `download.html` on whispawallet.com (the `#fp` div, in the siLNt repo)

**Publish the fingerprint somewhere other than the download page too** — the
GitHub profile, X, the Telegram channel. Someone who can serve a fake APK from
the site can serve a fake key beside it; a second source is what makes the
check mean anything. And keep the signing key off the build machine, on
hardware if you can: it is the one secret that lets anyone else's build pass
as yours.
