/*
 * The clients' chain guard, against the backend's own verdicts.
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARDS. A BIP-352 address carries its chain in the HRP and nowhere
 * else — sp1 for mainnet, tsp1 for everything else — and the keys inside are
 * the same bytes either way. So a mainnet sp1… pasted into a signet wallet
 * derives a perfectly valid SIGNET output. On-chain addresses are no better:
 * bc1q…, tb1q… and bcrt1q… convert to the identical scriptPubKey.
 *
 * The transaction therefore builds, signs, broadcasts and confirms, and the
 * money is gone — the recipient is scanning the other chain and never sees it.
 * Nothing bounces and nothing errors. It got all the way to the broadcast
 * confirmation on signet, and the same address saved as a contact silently.
 *
 * WHY A FIXTURE. helpers/chains.py is the authority and refuses the send
 * either way; services/chains.ts exists so the refusal arrives while the
 * address is being typed. That makes it a second copy of one rule, and a
 * second copy is the thing that drifts. The two must agree on the verdict AND
 * on the sentence, or one app refuses what the other explains differently.
 *
 * Regenerate the fixture when the rule changes:
 *   cd ../siLNt && python3 helpers/_chain_guard_fixtures.py > fixtures/chain-guard.json
 *
 * Run: node --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-chain-guard.mjs
