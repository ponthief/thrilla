# sign-release.sh — checksum and GPG-sign the release APKs.
#
# Produces the two files users need to verify a download:
#
#   SHA256SUMS      one line per APK, sha256sum(1) format
#   SHA256SUMS.asc  a detached, armoured GPG signature over SHA256SUMS
#
# Signing the checksum file rather than each APK is deliberate: one signature
# covers every artifact, and it's the layout Bitcoin Core and Tor use, so the
# verification steps on thrilla.me are the ones people may already know.
#
# It also prints the APK signing certificate fingerprint. That is a DIFFERENT
# and complementary check: Android enforces it on every update (an APK signed
# by another key cannot replace an installed Thrilla), so it protects users who
# never verify anything by hand — which is most of them. GPG protects the
# download itself, before it is ever installed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sign-release.sh                       # sign the repo-root APKs
#   scripts/sign-release.sh path/to/*.apk         # sign specific files
#   THRILLA_GPG_KEY=ABCD1234 scripts/sign-release.sh
#
# Env:
#   THRILLA_GPG_KEY   key id / fingerprint / email to sign with. Optional;
#                     without it gpg picks its default signing key.
