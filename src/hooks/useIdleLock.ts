// How long the app may sit unused before locking is a setting now
// (Settings → Security → Auto-lock, stored by services/appLock). Time spent in
// the background counts towards it: "unused" is measured from the last touch,
// and a backgrounded app receives none. That is what lets one timer cover both
// "left the app open on a desk" and "switched away to look something up".
//
// The zero case — lock the moment the app leaves the foreground — is handled in
// App.tsx instead, because there is nothing to wait for and no point running a
// timer for it.

// This used to sign the user out, which made sense when signing back in was the
// only way in: the session lived in memory and the password was the gate. Now
// the session is kept on the device and the gate is the app lock, so the timer
// LOCKS. Signing out would additionally erase the stored session, meaning an
// idle phone in a pocket cost the user their password on the next launch —
// punishing them for the timeout rather than protecting them.
//
// The protection is unchanged in substance: after ten idle minutes the wallet
// is behind a PIN or biometric prompt either way, and the duress PIN still
// answers coercion. Signing out is now only a deliberate act (Settings), a
// duress unlock, or the server rejecting the stored keys.
//
// Checked on a tick scaled to the chosen delay, and again whenever the app
// returns to the foreground — that second check is what covers being
// backgrounded past the timeout, since JS timers do not run reliably there.
// Root-level touch capture in App.tsx feeds activity via touchActivity().
