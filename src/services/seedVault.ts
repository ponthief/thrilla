// The recovery phrase, kept on this device so it can be shown again.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A NEW EXPOSURE: the keystore already holds this wallet's
// spendKey — "the spend key can move funds", per services/secureKeys — and its
// BIP-84 account xprv. Anything that can read the phrase out of the keystore
// could already have emptied the wallet with what was next to it. The phrase is
// marginally broader (it regenerates every derivation, including ones not made
// yet) but it is not the difference between safe and not.
//
// What it buys is the case that has no recovery today: the phrase is shown once
// at creation, and a user who was interrupted, or who wrote a word down wrong,
// had no second chance. The wallet kept working, so nothing looked wrong until
// the device was lost.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the BIP-39 passphrase. It is the one factor
// that is not on the device, so a keystore dump does not yield a working
// recovery of a passphrase-protected wallet. That also means the reveal is
// INCOMPLETE for those wallets, which the reveal has to say out loud — a user
// who thinks twelve words are enough will find out otherwise at the worst
// possible moment.
//
// Kept in its own keystore entry rather than inside the WalletKeys record so
// that reading keys for a scan or a send — which happens constantly — does not
// pull the phrase into JS memory. It is read only when it is being shown.
//
// Erased by the duress PIN and by wallet removal (services/secureKeys drives
// both from its index), and by the user directly, so anyone who would rather
// the phrase not be re-revealable can say so after backing it up.
