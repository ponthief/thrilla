 * until now only the lock screen set it: a prompt raised to confirm a send or
 * to reveal the recovery phrase locked the app behind itself, so authenticating
 * dropped the user on the lock screen instead of where they were going.
 *
 * Every re-authentication gate goes through here so none can forget again.
 * App.tsx clears the flag on the next foreground, which covers a prompt whose
 * promise never settles because the activity died under it.
