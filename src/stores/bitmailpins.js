/**
 * bitmailpins.js — client-side pinning of BitMail → SP address mappings.
 *
 * THREAT: the domain/DNS is controlled by an admin. A rogue admin could repoint
 * a user's BitMail (alice@domain) at a DIFFERENT SP address to steal incoming
 * funds. DNS alone can't detect this — there's no independent source of truth.
 *
 * DEFENSE (trust-on-first-use + continuous verification): when the user's OWN
 * BitMail is first seen as approved, we pin {bitmail -> the SP address it SHOULD
 * map to} locally, on the user's device — outside the admin's control. Later we
 * periodically re-resolve the BitMail over DNS and compare to the pin. A mismatch
 * means the record was changed and is surfaced as a loud alert.
 *
 * This protects the OWNER (they detect their address was hijacked) but cannot
 * protect a brand-new sender who never had a trusted copy. It also trusts the
 * value at first pin — so we pin the address the user's own wallet reports
 * (their intended SP address), not merely whatever DNS returns.
 *
 * Stored per-browser (localStorage). Like tx labels, this is client-only and
 * never sent to the server.
