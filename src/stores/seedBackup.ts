// A freshly generated recovery phrase that the user has not finished writing
// down yet.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the phrase is minted once and shown once. Nothing stores it
// — not the device keystore, not the server (silnt.wallets has no mnemonic
// column). Losing the reveal loses the only copy.
//
// It lived in CreateWalletModal's own state, and the app lock destroyed it: the
// lock screen REPLACES the wallet tree in App.tsx rather than covering it, so
// locking unmounted the modal, and unlocking came back to a wallet screen with
// no way to see the phrase again. The wallet still worked on that device, so
// the loss was silent until the device was lost too — the worst shape a bug can
// take in a wallet.
//
// So the phrase is held here instead, where a lock cannot reach it, and the
// modal reopens on it. IN MEMORY ONLY, deliberately: this is the one secret the
// app never persists, and the whole point of the reveal is that the user takes
// custody of it. Killing the app still loses it, which is why the idle lock is
// also held off while a backup is pending (see hooks/useIdleLock) — being
// locked out mid-word is what created the situation in the first place.
