/**
 * tangowatch — polls the Tango queue so a browser tab notices when it is your
 * turn.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The mobile app is told: the backend pushes on every
 * state change (views_api.py::_notify_tango) and the app shows a notification.
 * A browser tab is told nothing, so without this a partner only discovers a
 * round by happening to open the page — and a round expires in a day, with both
 * sides' coins reserved against it until it does.
 *
 * WHY EVERY TURN AND NOT JUST THE INVITATION. A Tango hands the turn back and
 * forth three times:
 *
 *   PROPOSED   B matches the denomination, contributes coins, and derives
 *   ACCEPTED   A derives and signs
 *   A_SIGNED   B signs, which completes and broadcasts
 *
 * A round stalled at A_SIGNED is worse than one that never started. The rule
 * below mirrors helpers/tango.py::whose_turn, which is the authority; this only
 * decides what to badge and what to toast, and the endpoints refuse
 * out-of-turn calls anyway.
 *
 * It also holds the list, and TangoView reads it from here rather than fetching
 * its own copy. Two pollers against one endpoint is twice the requests to show
 * one number, and they would disagree for a few seconds after every action —
 * which on that page means a Sign button drawn from stale state.
